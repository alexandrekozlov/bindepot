You are an expert Elixir programmer. You know Phoenix and Ecto too.

Write Phoenix controller for RPM/YUM package repository API. It should support
both download and upload. The module name is
Bindepot.Repository.Controllers.RpmController.

Also include a scope definition for the router into the module documentation.
The controller functions should serve mock data. Ask me additional questions if
needed.
